# Gravity and Spacetime Simulation

A 2D simulation game built with Pygame to explore gravitational interactions, spacetime distortion, and the illusion of time. This project visualizes the dynamic effects of gravity and allows players to interact with and manipulate a simulated universe.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gravitational Fields**:
  - Massive "red dot" objects distort spacetime, creating gravitational pull on dynamic masses.
  
- **Orbiting Mechanics**:
  - Dynamic masses transition into orbit when they approach a massive object within a defined radius.

- **Time Representation**:
  - Objects shrink as they spend time in high-gravity zones, eventually disappearing if sufficiently affected.

- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Drag and move red dot objects to dynamically update the gravitational field.
  - Random objects spawn at screen edges with varying sizes and velocities.

## Controls

- **Move Gravitational Objects**:
  - Click and drag the "red dots" (static masses) to reposition them.

- **Simulated Dynamics**:
  - Watch objects move, orbit, and shrink based on gravitational forces and their proximity to massive objects.

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyphesus/TimeSim
   cd TimeSim
   pip install pygame
